# My CV

I write my CV in LaTex (specifically [LuaTex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LuaTeX) in this file. The initial template was the [`Modern CV - Banking` from Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/articles/cv-bb/kznvdsnrdqjb), but I did a good amount of changes.

After I commit my changes, [GH Actions](https://github.com/umutseven92/CV/blob/master/.github/workflows/main.yml) compiles the `.tex` file into a `.pdf` file, and commits it into the repository as [`umutsevencv.pdf`](https://github.com/umutseven92/CV/blob/master/umutsevencv.pdf). This way anyone who has the link can always access my up to date CV.
